                <p>Lily Henry was adopted from China as a baby and currently lives in Middletown, Connecticut. As a young child, her mother always encouraged travel and exploration. When Lily was a Junior at Central Connecticut State University, she signed up for her first course abroad to her birth country. After that, her passion for travel was lit on fire and she was hooked! The following year, she did an additional course abraod to Spain and Morocco. The rest is history...</p>

                <p> Lily loves to look back at her photos and memories of traveling so she thought that this sight would be fun to share with other travel lovers! The Best of Bucketlist focuses on the best of the destinations she's visited, because behind all of the thousands of photos and journal entries, it's the overall lessons and experiences that matter. </p>

                <p>Outside of traveling, Lily enjoys trying new foods, finding local coffee shops, and spending time with family and friends. She currently works in areospace, and she teaches Intro to Business Analytics at the University of New Haven.</p>
